<!-- sites.xml specifies details of the sites that Swift can run on.

The entry for localhost should work on most linux-like systems
without any change.

It may be necessary to change /var/tmp to a different
working directory.

The jobThrottle profile is set to 0 so that Swift will not try to run more
than two jobs at once (the minimum) when using the local sites. This is
appropriate for local execution, but make sure if/when using another
execution mechanism to submit to an HPC resource that this jobThrottle
is updated.
